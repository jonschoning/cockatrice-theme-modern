## Modern Theme for Cockatrice

Motivating factors behind this theme:
 - Provide a neutral color palate that isn't biased torwards any particular color or lightness. 
 - Maximize the effect of the cards' colors on the on the battlefield.  
   - Light cards should appear lighter than the background
   - Dark cards should appear darker than the background
 - Avoid excessive/distracting ornamentation
 - Tighter, more streamlined sounds
 - Not a complete UI overhaul. 
   - Only the minimum changes necessary to achieve stated goals.
