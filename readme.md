## Modern Theme for Cockatrice

Put the files in the location specified here: https://github.com/Cockatrice/Cockatrice/wiki/Themes#what-is-a-theme

If you don't want to install the helvetica_condensed.ttf, then just delete the style.css file- all that does is alter the font on the UI interface a bit

The sound theme is technically separate from the UI theme, which is optional

You'll have to re-start cockatrice after switching to get the icons to load correctly.
