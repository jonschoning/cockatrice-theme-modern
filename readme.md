## Modern Theme for Cockatrice

Motivating factors behind this theme:
 - Provide a neutral color palate that isn't biased torwards any particular color or lightness. This maximizses the effect of the colors seen on the cards on the battlefield (e.g. light cards should appear light than the background, dark cards should appear darker than the background)
 - Avoid excessive ornamentation

This theme uses `helvetica_condensed.ttf` that is found in `themes/modern/helvetica_condensed.ttf` and needs to be installed.

If you don't want to install the `helvetica_condensed.ttf`, then just delete the style.css file or comment out the style for the font.

The sound theme is technically separate from the UI theme, which is optional

You'll have to re-start cockatrice after switching to get the icons to load correctly.
